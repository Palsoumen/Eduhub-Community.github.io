Blockchain technology has been one of the most trending topics in the world. It's not just a market phenomenon, but a revolution that will change how we use and do transactions.

Businesses have started to notice it too. Bitcoin Magazine says, "Many market observers believe blockchain could shake up various industries from accounting and banking to medical records and even government."

In layman terms, blockchain is a system where transactions are recorded publicly by people called 'miners' who take part in it with their computers for solving complex problems. This process verifies all the transactions done by users on this platform which makes them absolutely safe from hacking. It creates a record which cannot be hacked or manipulated as there are thousands of computers working simultaneously to create records.

The best thing about blockchain is that it's absolutely free for you to use and very transparent as everything is recorded openly.

So how does it work?

Imagine a library which has all the books of history since time immemorial, this is our blockchain platform. Now, the head librarian wants to update the book 'Blockchain Technology Explained.' All he needs to do is make a quick entry saying 'added on 1/1/2016' and sign his name beside it. He can't change or delete any earlier entries because everyone knows who entered what when and no one would trust him if he tried going against the rules of the system. The latest entry becomes part of history too so no one can question it.

This is how blockchain works. It's a distributed, decentralized database that keeps the records of every transaction done by people since time immemorial. Here there are no intermediaries like in traditional transactions so the users save on time and money which otherwise goes in paying banks or other financial institutions for their services. All they need to do is submit their proposal in bitcoin, litecoin etc., pay the necessary fees for miners to process the deal and voila! You get your funds transferred to you.

The best part about this system is that everything is transparent because of entries being recorded publicly on open books called 'blockchains' for all to see. People who are curious can about historical transactions which are available to everyone.
